The SVI data is delivered by census tract or county, and for this study, we used the SVI data at the county scale for consistency with the datasets described further below."

Conversely, roughly 13% (41,039,615) had an SVI rating &lt; 0.2 (SVI ranges from 0.0 - 1.0)(see chart below)."

Further, one stressor can have compounding effects as it interacts with the environment. For example, wildfires can negatively impact water supplies through increased erosion and contamination (e.g., volatile organic compounds). Here we used the Forest-to-Faucets (referred to as Fire Risk to Water, FRW) and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) datasets to explore the potential connections between wildfire risk, drinking water supplies and underserved populations. Additionally, we used the United States Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum Codes to further characterize the communities at risk by population density."
